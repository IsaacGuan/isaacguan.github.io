        <blockquote>
<p>We travel just to travel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world looks different when you bike. A car window is more or less a divide between the traveler and the outside world, a motorcycle engine could be too noisy for a person who loves a peaceful trip. Biking, however, makes you taste the true beauty of nature: suffering an exhausting uphill ride and then enjoying the kisses on the wind in a downhill.</p>
<p>I, as well as my roommate, Zhitong, had decided to take a bicycle trip to celebrate our graduation. We traveled from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai" target="_blank" rel="external">Shanghai</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen" target="_blank" rel="external">Xiamen</a>, biking around 1200 kilometers in total. The bike is not a fast vehicle that could only travel about 100 kilometers per day, so we were able to fully enjoy the beautiful scenery and experience people’s lives along the way.</p>
<h1 id="Day-1-Setting-Off"><a href="#Day-1-Setting-Off" class="headerlink" title="Day 1: Setting Off"></a>Day 1: Setting Off</h1><p>We set off on June 3rd, 2017.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d1_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d1 1"></p>
<p>It was a sunny and cloudless morning. By noon, we reached the province boundary of Shanghai and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang" target="_blank" rel="external">Zhejiang</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d1_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d1 2"></p>
<p>We went across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_%28China%29" target="_blank" rel="external">Beijing–Hangzhou Grand Canal</a> in the afternoon, which is the oldest and longest artificial river in the world, built over 1400 years ago and running over 1700 kilometers. Today, it is still heavily used by shipping.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d1_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d1 3"></p>
<h1 id="Day-2-Visiting-Hangzhou"><a href="#Day-2-Visiting-Hangzhou" class="headerlink" title="Day 2: Visiting Hangzhou"></a>Day 2: Visiting Hangzhou</h1><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou" target="_blank" rel="external">Hangzhou</a>, the capital city of Zhejiang Province, is one of the most visited cities in China, renowned for its historic relics as well as natural beauty. We arrived in Hangzhou on the previous night. Although both of us have been to this city before, we still took one rest day here and visited a few interesting places. Being an amateur in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy" target="_blank" rel="external">Chinese calligraphy</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiling_Seal_Art_Society" target="_blank" rel="external">Xiling Seal Art Society</a>, though little known by tourists, is one of my favorite spots in Hangzhou. It was founded over 100 years ago and is located in a garden on an island in the north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake" target="_blank" rel="external">West Lake</a>, where we could find a lot of art pieces of Chinese calligraphy and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_carving" target="_blank" rel="external">seal carving</a>. The picture below was taken inside the Xiling Seal Art Society. Written on the rock are two Chinese characters “闲泉” (read <em>xiánquán</em>) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_script" target="_blank" rel="external">seal script</a>, meaning free spring water.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d2_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d2 1"></p>
<p>For sure we also walked by the West Lake, the most tourist attractive place in Hangzhou. </p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d2_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d2 2"></p>
<h1 id="Day-3-Farewell-to-Urban-Life"><a href="#Day-3-Farewell-to-Urban-Life" class="headerlink" title="Day 3: Farewell to Urban Life"></a>Day 3: Farewell to Urban Life</h1><p>It was raining. Before setting out early in the morning, I took a photo of the lovely hostel that we stayed at in Hangzhou.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d3_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d3 1"></p>
<p>It kept raining. This made me feel that I was boating rather than biking.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d3_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d3 2"></p>
<p>Heading south all the way, we were gradually getting away from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River_Delta" target="_blank" rel="external">Yangtze River Delta</a>, which is dominated by modern cities, and coming into the country, where we could find traditional things such as this arch.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d3_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d3 3"></p>
<p>Leaving the city, mountains were ahead of us.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d3_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d3 4"></p>
<h1 id="Day-4-Hengdian-Chinawood-in-the-Mountains"><a href="#Day-4-Hengdian-Chinawood-in-the-Mountains" class="headerlink" title="Day 4: Hengdian, Chinawood in the Mountains"></a>Day 4: Hengdian, Chinawood in the Mountains</h1><p>We arrived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiwu" target="_blank" rel="external">Yiwu</a> the previous night. However, I was struck by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="external">IT band pain</a> and couldn’t ride a long distance the next day. So on day 4, we decided to make a short detour and ride to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hengdian_World_Studios" target="_blank" rel="external">Hengdian Town</a> only, which is about 30 kilometers southeast from Yiwu and where the largest film studio in China is located (so it is called <em>Chinawood</em>).</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d4_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d4 1"></p>
<p>Every year, tens of thousands of amateur actors/actresses come to this small town, playing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_%28acting%29" target="_blank" rel="external">extras</a> in movies or TV series, dreaming of becoming movie stars someday, though the chance is very little. These amateur actors/actresses almost take up half of the population in Hengdian and you come across them almost everywhere in the town. As you see, in the picture, an amateur actor was practicing his script.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d4_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d4 2"></p>
<p>Being passing travelers, we were not really interested in the film making things. We climbed up a hill and enjoyed the fascinating scenery of a Chinese mountain town in the sunset.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d4_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d4 3"></p>
<p>And we walked through the pedestrian street of Hengdian in the evening.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d4_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d4 4"></p>
<h1 id="Day-5-Rivers-amp-Mountains"><a href="#Day-5-Rivers-amp-Mountains" class="headerlink" title="Day 5: Rivers &amp; Mountains"></a>Day 5: Rivers &amp; Mountains</h1><p>We left Hengdian early in the morning, as the destination of this day was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lishui" target="_blank" rel="external">Lishui</a>, which is about 120 kilometers away. At the time of departure, I saw this sign, which is the title of the drama movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Somebody" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>I Am Somebody</em></a>, a movie about extras working in Hengdian.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d5_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d5 1"></p>
<p>We passed by a small village, Baita Village, in the morning, where villagers were making straw mats in a traditional manner. An old lady was using a big fan to blow away those defective straws.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d5_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d5 2"></p>
<p>The straws need to be dried in the sun.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d5_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d5 3"></p>
<p>South Zhejiang is a mountainous region where a lot of rivers flow through. People here build houses either by the river,</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d5_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d5 4"></p>
<p>or by the road. And usually, the houses are on the mountain, nestling against the slope.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d5_5.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d5 5"></p>
<p>We biked through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinyun_County" target="_blank" rel="external">Jinyun County</a> in the afternoon, which is famous for its pancake. I tried one, taking me only 5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi" target="_blank" rel="external">yuan</a>. It is filled up with meat, very juicy and tasty.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d5_6.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d5 6"></p>
<p>The national road in Zhejiang is really in nice condition. Pretty enjoyable ride!</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d5_7.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d5 7"></p>
<p>We arrived in Lishui in the evening. Lishui is a small city and a bit undeveloped. This makes some old things better preserved, for example, a busy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_market" target="_blank" rel="external">night market</a>, where you could always make good bargains, but now hard to find in big cities.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d5_8.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d5 8"></p>
<h1 id="Day-6-Chased-by-a-Rainstorm"><a href="#Day-6-Chased-by-a-Rainstorm" class="headerlink" title="Day 6: Chased by a Rainstorm"></a>Day 6: Chased by a Rainstorm</h1><p>Leaving Lishui, immediately we rode into the mountains. The weather was good in the morning when we were riding on a riverside road. </p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d6_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d6 1"></p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM, thunder rumbled from a distance, cool winds blew from the back. When turning around, I saw dark clouds gathering, indicating that a thunderstorm was coming, also indicating that we need some more speed.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d6_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d6 2"></p>
<p>Apparently, nobody can ride faster than winds and clouds. I took shelter in a roadside village when it started to rain, finding this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigandang" target="_blank" rel="external">Shigandang</a> tablet at the entrance of the village.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d6_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d6 3"></p>
<p>After the rain, it was pleasant to bike in the mist-shrouded mountains.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d6_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d6 4"></p>
<p>In the evening, we came to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingning_She_Autonomous_County" target="_blank" rel="external">Jingning County</a>, which is an autonomous county for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_people" target="_blank" rel="external">She people</a>. We tried some unique dishes, for example, the green Tofu, which is actually a kind of Tofu-like food made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premna" target="_blank" rel="external">Premna</a> leaves.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d6_5.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d6 5"></p>
<p>Besides, we found this interesting phenomenon: the smog rising on the light was actually caused by the raindrop falling on it.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d6_6.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d6 6"></p>
<h1 id="Day-7-Biking-through-the-Mountains"><a href="#Day-7-Biking-through-the-Mountains" class="headerlink" title="Day 7: Biking through the Mountains"></a>Day 7: Biking through the Mountains</h1><p>Jingning lies in a valley surrounded by mountains. This indicates a long uphill ride in front of us.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 1"></p>
<p>There are wild animals in the mountains. The sign in the picture warns people against feeding the monkeys passing by.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 2"></p>
<p>There are springs in the mountains as well. Although it is unsafe to drink spring water directly, we still tried a bit. The water tastes cold and sweet.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 3"></p>
<p>We reached the mountaintop in the afternoon, where there is a tunnel, and the altitude is over 1000m, the highest place we arrived during the trip. The sign by the tunnel entrance says that the continuous steep downhill ahead has caused 25 deaths.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 4"></p>
<p>During the downhill ride, we experienced the best mountain views throughout the trip:</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_5.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 5"></p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_6.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 6"></p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_7.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 7"></p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_8.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 8"></p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_9.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 9"></p>
<p>as well as lovely wildflowers in the sunset.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_10.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 10"></p>
<p>However, Zhitong’s bike got punctured. It took us some time to fix the tube.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_11.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 11"></p>
<p>Due to the issue of Zhitong’s bike, we couldn’t ride further and had to take a rest in Siqian Town, a small town in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taishun_County" target="_blank" rel="external">Taishun County</a>, lying in the foothills of the mountains. Fortunately, we met a man in the town, Zhangqiang, who used to travel around China by bike in 2010, raised funds while traveling, and donated the money for needy students in the mountains. We could even find <a href="http://www.wzrb.com.cn/article135850_256show.html" target="_blank" rel="external">a news report about him (in Chinese)</a>. He helped us repair the bike and treated us to dinner. We greatly appreciated his help!</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d7_12.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d7 12"></p>
<h1 id="Day-8-Coming-into-Fujian-Province"><a href="#Day-8-Coming-into-Fujian-Province" class="headerlink" title="Day 8: Coming into Fujian Province"></a>Day 8: Coming into Fujian Province</h1><p>We stayed in the small town for one night and set off the next morning, it was a sunny day.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 1"></p>
<p>A Double waterfall by the road. Local people call the falls <em>Hongyan Double Falls</em> or <em>the Couple Falls</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 2"></p>
<p>Zhitong’s bike was still not in good condition, so we found a bike repair shop in Taishun, and had the bike fixed. </p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 3"></p>
<p>The boundary line between Zhejiang and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian" target="_blank" rel="external">Fujian</a> lies only about 5 kilometers south to Taishun. We officially came into Fujian Province in the afternoon. I have a photo of me standing by the cross-boundary bridge at the boundary line.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 4"></p>
<p>It seems like that some Chinese customs and traditions are better preserved in Fujian, for example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_shrine" target="_blank" rel="external">ancestral shrine</a>, where people perform ancestor worship.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_5.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 5"></p>
<p>And there is also an interesting old house. </p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_6.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 6"></p>
<p>An old peasant.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_7.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 7"></p>
<p>A town in the valley, which was very quiet and almost empty. We conjectured that young people had basically left such remote mountain towns for cities to either pursue their study or work.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_8.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 8"></p>
<p>Look back down the valley and the town that we had passed by.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_9.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 9"></p>
<p>A small brick kiln. The red clay here in the mountains is very suitable for brick making.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d8_10.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d8 10"></p>
<h1 id="Day-9-A-Super-Hot-Day"><a href="#Day-9-A-Super-Hot-Day" class="headerlink" title="Day 9: A Super Hot Day"></a>Day 9: A Super Hot Day</h1><p>We stayed the previous night in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang,_Shouning_County" target="_blank" rel="external">Nanyang Town</a>, a small mountain town. In the morning, we started down the road by a mountain stream. It was downhill all the way. People built a small dam on the stream.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d9_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d9 1"></p>
<p>The dam does not let too much water through.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d9_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d9 2"></p>
<p>We came to another mountain town, Wuqu Town. Written on the door was a piece of military conscription, in pretty good handwriting.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d9_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d9 3"></p>
<p>The sun was shining fiercely, so we took a short rest in the town, and tried some Bian Rou, a kind of Fujianese style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonton" target="_blank" rel="external">wonton</a>, over a roadside snack stall.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d9_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d9 4"></p>
<p>Due to the hot weather, we couldn’t ride for a very long distance this day and finally arrived in Saiqi, a town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu%27an" target="_blank" rel="external">Fu’an</a>. People in Fujian have their own unique religious belief, the worship of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazu" target="_blank" rel="external">Mazu</a>. We saw this Mazu temple on our way.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d9_5.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d9 5"></p>
<h1 id="Day-10-Ningde-the-First-Seaside-City-of-Our-Trip"><a href="#Day-10-Ningde-the-First-Seaside-City-of-Our-Trip" class="headerlink" title="Day 10: Ningde, the First Seaside City of Our Trip"></a>Day 10: Ningde, the First Seaside City of Our Trip</h1><p>It was a cloudy day, we still had to ride in the mountains before we reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningde" target="_blank" rel="external">Ningde</a>, the northernmost seaside city of Fujian. There is a converting station in the mountains.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d10_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d10 1"></p>
<p>The advertisement on the wall says that this guy sells guns. Considering the extremely strict gun control policy in China, such advertisements are probably deceptive, which means you won’t get anything after paying him money.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d10_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d10 2"></p>
<p>A small waterfall flowing between mountains.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d10_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d10 3"></p>
<p>Crossing the bridge, we came into Ningde. On the bridge it writes a verse of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong" target="_blank" rel="external">Chairman Mao</a>: “虎距龙盘今胜昔, 天翻地覆慨而慷”, translated as <em>The city, a tiger crouching, a dragon curling, outshines its ancient glories; In heroic triumph heaven and earth have been overturned</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d10_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d10 4"></p>
<h1 id="Day-11-Seeing-the-Sea-Finally"><a href="#Day-11-Seeing-the-Sea-Finally" class="headerlink" title="Day 11: Seeing the Sea, Finally"></a>Day 11: Seeing the Sea, Finally</h1><p>We planned to get to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzhou" target="_blank" rel="external">Fuzhou</a> this day. According to the map, the sea was only a few kilometers away from us. However, there were still quite a few mountains on our way.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d11_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d11 1"></p>
<p>From the mountain road, we could see a factory by the sea.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d11_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d11 2"></p>
<p>And finally, we reached a coastal road, although the bay by the road was not beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d11_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d11 3"></p>
<h1 id="Day-12-Visiting-Fuzhou"><a href="#Day-12-Visiting-Fuzhou" class="headerlink" title="Day 12: Visiting Fuzhou"></a>Day 12: Visiting Fuzhou</h1><p>Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province, famous for the hundreds of big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyan" target="_blank" rel="external">Banyan</a> trees planted in the city, has a poetic nickname <em>Rongcheng</em>, meaning the city of Banyan.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d12_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d12 1"></p>
<p>I was a bit surprised when I saw such a large mosque in Fuzhou, as I had thought everybody here is Mazuist. Actually, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzhou_Mosque" target="_blank" rel="external">Fuzhou Mosque</a> was built almost 800 years ago, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty" target="_blank" rel="external">Yuan dynasty</a>, and is one of the most ancient mosques in China.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d12_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d12 2"></p>
<p>In the evening, I went to the old alleys of Fuzhou, to experience some traditional atmosphere of the city.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d12_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d12 3"></p>
<h1 id="Day-13-Setting-Off-Alone"><a href="#Day-13-Setting-Off-Alone" class="headerlink" title="Day 13: Setting Off Alone"></a>Day 13: Setting Off Alone</h1><p>Still having an exam to take, Zhitong had to go back to Shanghai from Fuzhou. I carried on with my trip alone. Xiamen was only 234 kilometers ahead of me.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d13_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d13 1"></p>
<p>I reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putian" target="_blank" rel="external">Putian</a> by afternoon. It was raining for the whole day.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d13_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d13 2"></p>
<h1 id="Day-14-Endless-Rain"><a href="#Day-14-Endless-Rain" class="headerlink" title="Day 14: Endless Rain"></a>Day 14: Endless Rain</h1><p>The road was under construction outside Putian, where the road condition was made even worse by the rain.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d14_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d14 1"></p>
<p>Very interestingly, I came across a Mongolian village. I had thought Mongolians only live in North Asia.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d14_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d14 2"></p>
<p>I arrived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou" target="_blank" rel="external">Quanzhou</a> at the end of the day, a city used to be a major port for foreign traders and hometown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Chinese" target="_blank" rel="external">overseas Chinese</a>, and stayed there for the night. The buildings over there are in a style mixing east with west.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d14_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d14 3"></p>
<h1 id="Day-15-Arriving-in-Xiamen"><a href="#Day-15-Arriving-in-Xiamen" class="headerlink" title="Day 15: Arriving in Xiamen"></a>Day 15: Arriving in Xiamen</h1><p>Xiamen is only about 90 kilometers from Quanzhou, so this was the last day of my bike tour. There was a big traffic jam on the way to Xiamen.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d15_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d15 1"></p>
<p>The boundary marker of Xiamen, carrying a lot of names and comments from previous travelers.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d15_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d15 2"></p>
<p>Due to the rain, the cross-sea bridge to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen_Island" target="_blank" rel="external">Xiamen Island</a> was temporarily closed to pedestrians and cyclists. So I had to take a 5-minute shuttle bus ride to get into the city. </p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d15_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d15 3"></p>
<p>I met up with this interesting guy on arrival in Xiamen when we were both sheltering from the rain under an overpass. He talked with me about some local customs and traditional worships here. Actually, apart from Mazu, Xiamenese people worship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nezha" target="_blank" rel="external">Nezha</a> as well. He took me to a temple of Nezha later and showed me around the temple. </p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d15_4.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d15 4"></p>
<p>The Nezha temple.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d15_5.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d15 5"></p>
<h1 id="Day-16-to-Day-18-Visiting-Xiamen"><a href="#Day-16-to-Day-18-Visiting-Xiamen" class="headerlink" title="Day 16 to Day 18: Visiting Xiamen"></a>Day 16 to Day 18: Visiting Xiamen</h1><p>I found a youth hostel on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulangyu" target="_blank" rel="external">Gulangyu</a>, a small and artsy island off the coast of Xiamen, renowned for its varied architecture and multicultural history.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d16_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d16 1"></p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d16_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d16 2"></p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d16_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d16 3"></p>
<p>The next day, I went to the east beach, from where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinmen" target="_blank" rel="external">Kinmen Islands</a>, which are still governed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" target="_blank" rel="external">Republic of China</a>, were within my sight.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d17_1.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d17 1"></p>
<p>There is a big propaganda sign on the coast of Xiamen facing the Kinmen Islands, telling the hope of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_unification" target="_blank" rel="external">Chinese reunification</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d17_2.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d17 2"></p>
<p>I also visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen_University" target="_blank" rel="external">Xiamen University</a> and walked through the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297407-d6418938-Reviews-Furong_Tunnel-Xiamen_Fujian.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Furong Tunnel</a>, which is filled with graffiti designed by university students.</p>
<p><img src="/img/from_shanghai_to_xiamen/d17_3.jpg" alt="from shanghai to xiamen d17 3"></p>
<p>I stayed in this lovely coastal city (though the rainy weather was a bit frustrating) for 3 days, also tried as much local seafood as possible. On the last day of my stay, when taking a ferry from Gulangyu to Xiamen, I took this skyline picture, drawing the modern face of the city. It was the last picture of our trip.</p>
